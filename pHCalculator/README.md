# Acid-Base Titration pH Calculator
Take away the pain of calculating the pH of the resulting solution from an acid-base titration with this pH calculator!

This application calculates the pH of the resulting solution from a strong acid-strong base or a weak acid-weak base titration.

Enter the identity of the acid along with the molarity and volumes for the acid and base solutions.  Enter acid identity using the chemical formula of the acid (for example sulfuric acid as H2SO4).
