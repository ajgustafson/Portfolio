Did you attempt to make your computer "smart"? How did you determine which piece
to play next?
> The computer chooses the move that will flip the greatest number of tiles.
If there are two or more moves that flip the same number of tiles, the computer
just chooses the first move in the dictionary.

Is your computer as smart as you would like?
> My computer could be smarter.  I could add method to determine a better move
if there is more than one move that will flip the most number of tiles.

How often did your computer beat you?
> Actually, the computer beat me almost every time (!), although I am not sure
if that can be attributed to a "smart" computer or a terrible human! ;) When I
initially created the computer method to choose a move, I had it choose a random
move out of the valid moves dictionary.  With this method, I beat the computer
almost every time, so the longest flips method is definitely more effective.

How would you improve it in the future?
> I would research Othello strategy to learn about how to choose the most
effective moves.
> One thing I don't like about my computer strategy is that if the human plays
the same tiles every time, the computer will respond in the same way every time.
I would like to add some element that allows the computer to "learn" which moves
are most effective by keeping track of game results and weighting move choices
at the end of the game based on game results.  I think this would lead to the
computer playing a slightly different game each time even if the user tried to
play the same moves.
> Finally, this doesn't have to do with the AI, but one thing that I need to
fix in the game is its ending.  The onscreenclick function really confuses me
and I couldn't figure out how to get the program to terminate at the end.
